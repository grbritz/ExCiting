Features for extraction:
-- If there is a single citation or list of citations at the conclusion of a sentence, take the whole sentence and apply it to each citation.
-- If there's more than one citation per sentence, see if they are on different phrases/sentences joined by a conjunction. If they are, extract the two sibling phrase/sentences and assign each one to the citation they contain/
-- If a citation is used as a subject of a sentence, take the rest of the sentence as a description.
-- If a citation directly follows a NP, then that NP might be descriptive.

** Coreferences might be nice...
