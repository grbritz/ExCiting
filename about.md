#### Motivation
Knowing which papers are relevant to your work is a hard and tedious process. Currently it requires reading through, at minimum, dozens of abstracts to know where to begin. Then you need to actually read those papers, decide if they are still relevant, and weave the relevant ones into your paper as you write it. We wanted to make this process easier for academics.
#### The Idea
When an author cites another paper in the body of her own paper, she usually describes some aspect of that paper that was useful to her work. For popular papers, there may be hundreds of such descriptions. If one were to aggregate all of these descriptions and summarize their content, we could get a good idea of what a paper is about. This might result in using less text than an abstract does, or it might give an alternative perspective on whats important in the paper.
